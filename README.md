Video Cutter

The Video Cutter is a Python script that allows you to split a long video into multiple parts based on the desired length of each part. With this tool, you can easily extract shorter clips from a longer video, which can be useful for a variety of purposes such as sharing on social media, creating promotional videos, or simply organizing your video content.

The script uses the moviepy library to work with video files, and allows you to specify the desired length of each part in seconds. The tool automatically calculates the number of parts needed based on the duration of the input video, and extracts each part using the subclip method of the VideoFileClip object. Each part is saved to a separate video file, with a filename that includes the part number.

Usage

To use the Video Cutter, simply download the Python script and run it on your input video file. The script will automatically split the video into parts and save them to your local directory. You can then use the extracted video clips for your desired purpose.


This tool is useful for anyone who works with video content and needs to extract shorter clips from longer videos. It's easy to use, customizable, and can save you a lot of time and effort compared to manually extracting video clips.
